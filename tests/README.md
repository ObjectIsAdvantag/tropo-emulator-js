# Tropo Ready Samples

These samples are a copy of the [Tropo Javascript Samples](https://github.com/tropo/tropo-samples/tree/master/javascript)
enhanced with :
- declarations for variables to make debugging more convenient (ie, introspection of local variables),
- enhanced loops to work around the hangup event (see 17-collectmoredigits)
- extra outbound samples (send-sms.js, bidirectional-sms.js, transfer-outbound.js)

This set of samples will be extended with [scripts contributed by the community](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/tropo-ready-vscode#contribute).


## Quick start

Run `make` to see samples executions via the Tropo emulator.

Tip: look at the launch arguments for Inbound/Outbound & Voice/SMS samples.
